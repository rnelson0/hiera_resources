This module has been deprecated in favor of using Puppet's own iteration. See [R.I.Piennar's](http://twitter.com/ripienaar) blog for [examples of declaring resources with iteration](https://www.devco.net/archives/2015/12/16/iterating-in-puppet.php), as well as the [Puppet docs](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_iteration.html#declaring-resources).
